## Prerequisites and setting up the environment

### 1.1 Prerequisites - rerun experiments on latest versions

Before we set out to understand the source code and design of python it is imperative that we
understand the setup of the system required.
Below are listed the prerequisites that are required to setup python on your machine. If you
already know how to compile python from source feel free to skip this section.
1. Linux based Operating System preferably Ubuntu version greater 12.04. All the
experiments were based on Ubuntu 12.04.
2. Python source code
(https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/Python-3.6.0.tgz)
3. Eclipse for C/C++
(http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/neon2)
4. gdb
5. make
Once you have this checklist ready we can proceed to setup python for debugging.

### 1.2​ Setting up the environment

Let us examine the steps for setting up eclipse and python for debugging.
1. Make a folder under your home directory and name it python-source.
(Example: /home/ubuntu/python-source).
2. Extract the contents of the python source code downloaded into the folder
using the command $tar -xvzf <downloaded_python_tar>
<folder_to_extract>
3. Enter the folder in the command line using the command $cd
python-source.
4. Type the command $ ./configure –with-pydebug to enable debugging of
the source code.
5. When the command completes without errors enter the next command
$make -j8. Where 8 is the number of CPU cores. This could vary on your
system. Type the appropriate number.
6. Open Eclipse and create a new C/C++ project and name it python-source.
7. Select Import in Eclipse menu as shown in the pictures below.

8. Complete the wizard by selecting the folder from the menu and the project
to import to as python-source.
9. Select the Run Menu and then select Debug Configurations to open the
debug menu as shown below.
